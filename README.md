# End-to-End UI Testing with Selenium, Cucumber, Jenkins, and Java

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform end-to-end UI testing using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) in Java. Additionally, it incorporates Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) automation. The goal is to validate the functionality of web applications through automated tests written in a natural language format and ensure all UI components work together as expected.

## Features

- **Automated UI Testing**: Execute end-to-end tests to validate web applications across various browsers.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Write tests in a human-readable format using Cucumber's Gherkin syntax.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test the application on different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- **Continuous Integration with Jenkins**: Automate the testing process using Jenkins for streamlined execution on code changes.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports to track results and identify issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The programming language used for writing tests.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: A browser automation tool for testing web applications.
- **Cucumber**: A tool for BDD that allows writing tests in Gherkin language.
- **TestNG**: Frameworks for structuring and executing tests.
- **Maven**: Dependency management tool for Java projects.
- **ExtentReports**: For generating readable and informative test reports.
- **Jenkins**: An automation server for continuous integration and continuous deployment.

## Getting Started
